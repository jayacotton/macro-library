WC

It is easy to trick WC word count, all you need is 2 spaces in a row to get
a word.  Not ideal.

wc is usefull for counting the number of lines in a text file, and the number
of characters in the file.

This may be better that using a file size program, since file size is rounded up the
the next sector size.  If you need a more 'acurate' size use wc.
