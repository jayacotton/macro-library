MACRO-LIBRARY A library of macro's tailord for 8080/z80 microprocessors
and CP/M 2.2 or 3.0.

These macros are intedended to be processed by MACRO and assembled with
asm8080.

See https://github.com/jayacotton/macro for further information about
MACRO and https://github.com/jayacotton/asm8080 for information about
asm8080.

In general you should assume that all your registers will be used.  So,
any valuble data must be stored or pushed befor using any of these macros.

The macro's 

16550.mac
	The 16550 is an SIO chip used on many CP/M systems, and RC2014
in particular.  Most of the code was written by Ben Chong, and I did the
macro wrapper.

Invocation:
	#include "16550.mac"
	.......

	<optional name>	s16550	getchar,putchar

The optional name is just that.  You don't need to provide a lable
here, but if you do, you can call it to reinit the sio chip.

Getchar, and putchar are arbitrary function names.  You must provide 
a name there so you can call the name to get or put a character on the
sio chip.

This code does not provide interrupt driven i/o.  The device base address
is 0d0hex.

binascii.mac
	This macro will convert a string of binary digits into ascii
for further processing.

Invocation:
	#include "binascii.mac"
	.......

	<optional name>	binascii	opt,out,buf,count

		opt is print (p) or store (s)
		out is 0 or address for storage
		buf is output buffer
		count is number of digits to convert

See ~/test/radix for an example of binascii usage

btod.mac
	This macro will convert the indicated binary number to base 10
and return HL pointing to a string of ascii digits.

	The macro requires additional macros, memset, usmod, usdiv, usmul, 
sub, and uslt.

Invocation:
	#include "btod.mac"  / and a bunch of others.
	.......

	<optional name>	btod	mybinhere

		mybinhere is the address of the 16 bit binary (base 2) 
			number to be converted.

	On exit, HL -> an ascii string of base 10 digits.
